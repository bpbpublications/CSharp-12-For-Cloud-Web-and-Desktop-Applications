## About the Book
The world of application development is constantly changing with the rise of open-source languages and technologies. Since Microsoft made the .NET platform and C# open-source in 2014, a vibrant community of developers has contributed to the language's evolution on GitHub. Microsoft releases a new version of .NET every year, leading to newer patterns, frameworks, and design approaches in active application development. 

Learn C# 11 & 12 and use Entity Framework Core for data management. Explore cloud development with Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, and Blob Storage. Implement async communication with Azure Service Bus and secure apps with Azure Key Vault. Build web apps with Blazor and ASP.NET, and add real-time features with SignalR. Discover microservices with Web APIs, and streamline your workflow using Azure DevOps and Docker. Develop applications for mobile, desktop, and Windows with .NET MAUI, Blazor Hybrid, and WinUI.

Upon completion, readers will have a solid understanding of the latest C# features and how they fit into current design approaches.
